# ResBaz2023 Workshop: Generating Graphs using Python and ChatGPT

Welcome to the "Generating Graphs using Python and ChatGPT" workshop, part of ResBaz2023. This repository contains example datasets and pre-made scripts to help you learn how to leverage ChatGPT to code Python graphs for data science purposes.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to use ChatGPT, a powerful language model, to assist in generating Python code for creating graphs. The goal is to streamline the process of visualizing data for data science and analysis. We have provided example datasets and scripts in the repository to guide you through the hands-on exercises.
